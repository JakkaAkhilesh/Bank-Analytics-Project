During my internship with AI Variant Company, I undertook a project focused on data analysis. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the available data, extracting insights and trends. Utilizing my skills in Tableau and Power BI, I created various dashboards to visually represent and communicate the findings. The data for these dashboards was extracted from Excel, showcasing proficiency in data extraction and manipulation. This project allowed me to apply my analytical skills and enhance my visualization capabilities through the creation of impactful dashboards, contributing to the overall data-driven decision-making process at AI Variant Company.
